    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lechon kawali is a Filipino favorite of crispy fried pork belly that’s famous for its combination of crackling skin and irresistibly juicy meat. Lechon means pork, and kawali is the name of the wok-like Filipino pan it’s traditionally fried in. The dish’s unique texture comes from first boiling the belly to render the fat and tenderize the meat, then allowing it to air-dry to remove excess moisture. Finally, the pork is fried until golden on the outside, melt-in-your-mouth tender inside and crowned with crunchy, crackling skin. It’s usually cut into one- or two-bite pieces and served with a tasty sauce like Sarsa (Lechon Sauce) or a vinegar-based Sawsawan (dipping sauce) to enhance the flavor and cut the richness of the meat. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds boneless pork belly, skin on</li>
        <li>1 bunch scallions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 stalk lemongrass, smashed and sliced on the bias</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
        <li>3 Thai bird chiles, sliced</li>
        <li>6 whole star anise</li>
        <li>5 dried bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons black peppercorns</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Canola oil, for deep-frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Place the pork belly skin-side down in a large wide pot and add water to cover. Add the scallions, lemongrass, garlic, chiles, star anise, bay leaves, peppercorns and 3 tablespoons salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the pot. Simmer for about 1 hour, then flip the pork so it’s skin-side up. Cover and simmer for another hour.</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove the pot from the heat and allow the meat to cool in the liquid until it reaches room temperature, about 1 hour. Once cooled, scrape off any aromatics clinging to it and transfer the pork to a rack set over a sheet pan. Pat it dry. Rub 1 tablespoon of salt into the skin and place it on the rack skin-side up. Refrigerate the pork, uncovered, 8 hours or overnight to air dry. </p></li>
        <li><p>Fill a large Dutch oven halfway with oil and heat over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 375 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with a wire rack. </p></li>
        <li><p>Cut the pork into long strips about 1-inch wide, making sure each piece has some skin. Season the strips with 2 tablespoons salt. Working in batches, fry the strips in the hot oil, turning them occasionally, until golden brown and the skin is puffy and crispy, about 8 minutes. If the oil splatters you can cover it partially with a lid, making sure that it’s left enough ajar for steam to easily escape. </p></li>
        <li><p>Transfer the pork to a wire rack to cool slightly, then cut the strips into 1-inch pieces. </p></li>
